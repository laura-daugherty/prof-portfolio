											<p>The portfolio is one of the most personal projects to work on. It’s a chance to really 
												show who I am, what I can do, and what makes me an individual. Since <strong>designing and 
													implementing a portfolio is so essential</strong>, I spent quite a while choosing a template to 
												work with that fits my personality, and was flexible enough to make truly my own. I 
												chose a light, bright design to convey a sense of spirit, energy, and freshness. I like 
												to think I bring a breath of fresh air to any team I work on, and really wanted my portfolio 
												site to reflect this.</p>
											<p>I consciously chose a template reminiscent of a newspaper, because my site has great news - 
												that I am available to join your team! I also made sure to choose a template that is <strong>mobile 
													friendly</strong> because users are often on the go and it is vital to cater to as many users as possible. </p>
											<p>One of the most essential features of my portfolio that was most meaningful to me, was 
												to go through all of my projects from my time at school and deploy them so anyone can click 
												around and take a look at my work. I spent many hours going through each project individually, 
												<strong>revisiting my work, improving it and deploying it</strong> to make it accessible to whoever may want to 
												explore my work.</p>
											<p>I also wanted to make sure I was able to highlight my other hobbies, interests and skills. I 
												think that being well rounded as a person translates to a quality employee and teammate. My arts 
												and crafts are important to me, and show that I’m an intelligent, well-rounded individual.</p>
											<p>Lastly on my portfolio I needed a place to showcase my writing. Writing is an imperative skill 
												in the modern workplace and it’s vital to demonstrate that I can write effectively. It also 
												gives me an opportunity to discuss experiences and things I’ve learned through the process of putting 
												together my portfolio.</p>

I built the backend for this project using Node.js. I put together a database of celebrities from scratch for the frontend team to use to build the app. See the repo on <a href="https://github.com/laura-daugherty/BackEnd-1" target=_blank>Github</a></p>

											<h3>My Project Journey</h3>
											<p>The number one best experience I've had since starting my Lambda School journey was the opportunity to work on so many <strong>cross-discipline projects</strong>.
												I've had the amazing opportunity to work with over 50 new faces from different backgrounds, at different levels in their experience, with different attitudes, strengths and weaknesses. 
												I've learned that this is where I thrive. <strong>To bring together a team to create something out of nothing is one of the most rewarding parts of my education.</strong></p>
												<p>I've always been obsessed with teamwork. In a previous life I worked in restaurant kitchens as a line cook. The greatest sin on "the line" is to let down your team.
													 and that will always be my golden rule. Through my experience in the kitchen and now through doing 5 short term and 1 long term web development projects with widely varying teams, I've come to learn more than a few things.
													 Each has a special dynamic that needs to be respected in order to work together efficiently. There's a delicate give and take that brings the team to its most productive state. No one player
													 can put their needs over the needs of the group. Teams need leadership and structure, and those often don't come from the same source, although they should work hand in hand, it's important to respect both equally.
												</p>
												<p>
													Despite all the knowledge I've gained working in teams, I realize that there is always so much more to learn about teamwork and team dynamics. Each team is different and has its own learning curve, and <strong>I hope to never stop learning</strong>.

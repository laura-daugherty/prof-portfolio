											<p>After High School I decided to go to Culinary School. I loved cooking, 
                        love cooking, and will always love cooking. I’ve always had a scientific 
                        approach to the culinary arts that didn’t always jive with my more free-wheeling 
                        classmates. After school I moved on to working as a line cook in various restaurants, 
                        ending up at a brewery in Athens, Ohio.</p><p><strong>In typical pre-software-engineer fashion, 
													I proceeded to  reorganize and standardize the recipe book.</strong> In addition to standardizing
                         recipes I began a fermentation program for making pickles and sauerkraut for the restaurant.</p>
                        <p>After my time in the culinary world, I decided it was time to move on from the restaurant 
                          lifestyle and pursue a career working with a small jewelry designer. After working a couple 
                          different positions for her over the course of six months I was promoted to Showroom Manager. 
                          Here <strong>I really discovered my passion for doing MORE in an organization.</strong> </p> <p>Working at Colleen 
                          Mauer Designs I had the opportunity to make direct changes to the business and see the effects
                           my changes had on sales and how the business is run, but more importantly, I could see 
                           the effect I had on the customers.</p><p>One of the last projects I worked on, and one 
                            of my favorites was to write a manual for running the shop. Up until this point there was 
                            no source of truth for information about how to run the business. I created a physical and 
                            digital book encompassing everything from how to process returns, make coupons for the website, 
                            information about jewelry materials to how to access security footage.</p><p>All of these experiences
														 have culminated in a well-rounded, experienced employee with an itch to do more. At each of these organizations
														 and throughout my time working I've tried to go above and beyond for each organization, <strong>pushing my team
															and myself towards excellence.</strong> I hope to find a position that affords me the ability to use my skills to positively impact
															 the customer and my team.
